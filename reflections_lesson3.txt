Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For the same reasons you decide on manual commits to create changes that represent logical commits 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a clone on github that you would use to modify existing work while giving credit to original author. clone can happen locally to copy . branch is used to create an experimental version of existing code and potentially merge back into it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
so you can make changes to the most recent copy and avoid conflicts
